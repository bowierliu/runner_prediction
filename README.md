# Sports Analytics Course Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a graduate school assignment in the Sports Analytics course. The primary objective of the assignment is to analyze sports data, derive meaningful insights, and implement predictive models to enhance decision-making in sports-related contexts.

## Contents
- **assignment.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the data preprocessing, analysis, and model implementation.
- **data/**: Directory containing relevant datasets used for the analysis.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project and setup instructions.
- **results/**: Folder for storing output files, visualizations, and model evaluation metrics.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of Python libraries and dependencies required to run the notebook.

## Goals and Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the sports dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
- Implement predictive models (e.g., regression, classification) to analyze performance metrics.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following software installed on your system:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook assignment.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to execute the analysis and view the results.

## Results and Discussion
The notebook contains detailed analysis and visualizations to support the findings. Key results are stored in the `results/` folder for reference.
