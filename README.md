# Sports Analytics Course Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a graduate school assignment in the Sports Analytics course. The primary objective of the assignment is to analyze sports data, derive meaningful insights, and implement predictive models to enhance decision-making in sports-related contexts.

## Contents
- **assignment.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the data preprocessing, analysis, and model implementation.
- **data/**: Directory containing relevant datasets used for the analysis.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project and setup instructions.
- **results/**: Folder for storing output files, visualizations, and model evaluation metrics.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of Python libraries and dependencies required to run the notebook.

## Goals and Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the sports dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
- Implement predictive models (e.g., regression, classification) to analyze performance metrics.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Acknowledgments
This assignment is part of the Sports Analytics course in the graduate program. The dataset and guidelines were provided by the course instructor.
